Excel Spreadsheet Processing with Python (Using openpyxl)
This Python script utilizes the openpyxl library to process an Excel spreadsheet named transactions.xlsx. It performs the following operations:

Loading the Workbook:

Loads the Excel workbook transactions.xlsx using openpyxl.
Iterating through Rows:

Iterates through each row in the worksheet named 'Sheet1' starting from the second row (row 2) to the last row (sheet.max_row).
Calculating Corrected Prices:

Retrieves the value from the third column (cell = sheet.cell(row, 3)) which presumably contains prices.
Applies a correction by multiplying the price by 0.9 to simulate a 10% discount (corrected_price = cell.value * 0.9).
Updating the Spreadsheet:

Writes the corrected price into the fourth column (corrected_price_cell = sheet.cell(row, 4)).
Generating a Bar Chart:

Extracts data from the corrected price column (min_col=4, max_col=4) using Reference.
Creates a bar chart using BarChart() and adds the data to the chart.
Adding the Chart to the Worksheet:

Inserts the generated bar chart into the worksheet at cell E2 (sheet.add_chart(chart, 'E2')).
Saving the Workbook:

Saves the modified workbook back to transactions.xlsx.
Prerequisites
To run this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the openpyxl library if it's not already installed:

bash
