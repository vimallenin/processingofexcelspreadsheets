# Excel Spreadsheet Processing with openpyxl

This project demonstrates how to use the `openpyxl` library in Python to process an Excel spreadsheet. Specifically, it shows how to:

1. Load an Excel workbook.
2. Iterate through the rows of a sheet to modify data.
3. Create and insert a bar chart based on the modified data.
4. Save the updated workbook.

## Prerequisites

You will also need to install the `openpyxl` library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
python process_transactions.py
